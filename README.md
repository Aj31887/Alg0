Alg0 - Algorithm Coder Tool
===========================

I am a firm believer in the freedom of speech in the aim of creating a healthy and constructive discussion between humans as a main tool to solve problems by establishing a stream of communication discussing all issues, even controversial ones.

When a computer program censors, shadow bans and removes your speech just because you mentioned a topic deemed too controversial to talk about, here lies a problem that hinders the healthy discussion between humans.

This tool attempts to solve this problem (bypass it, rather) by replacing some letters in the alphabet with different letters that looks identical. The aim is passing through the censorship of the bots.
This idea itself is nothing new. Similar tools already exist. I wanted to build my own anyway.
